# Improvements & Future Plans

## Unified WebSocket Endpoint
**Status**: In Progress
One unified websocket endpoint /voice_chat/ws for all three operations of STT → Chat → TTS, rather than having HTTP calls for all three. This would improve the latency significantly and is scalable.

## Refine Prompts with Examples
Provide examples through One-shot, Few-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting and evaluate each approach for optimal performance.

## Evaluate STT Models
Test different Speech-to-Text models for improved initial language and word detection, exploring optimizations from providers like ElevenLabs.

## Better Turn Detection
Enable natural interruption while the agent is speaking (similar to ChatGPT voice mode) by keeping the mic open and filtering agent speech from user input.

## Multithreading & Queuing
Implement robust multithreading and request queuing to handle simultaneous requests without performance degradation.

## Session Storage
Replace in-memory storage with persistent session storage for improved reliability and state management.

## Memory Management
Implement Graphiti or simple JSON-based memory generated by external LLM calls through tool usage.

## Crisis Intervention Documents
Integrate proven crisis intervention documents as embeddings with models specialized in reranking, such as Jina Embeddings v4 for multimodal, multilingual retrieval.

## Data Security
Implement authentication, data encryption, and privacy controls to protect sensitive user information.

## Infrastructure Improvements
Implement GitHub CI/CD actions for deployment, AWS backend with security measures (VPC, IAM), key rotation, and Vault secrets for production-grade infrastructure.

## Orchestration framework
Can use LangChain/google-adk if advanced need for sessions, cost-saving measures by summarizing or stripping tokens from context intelligently, tool usage, multi-agent systems, etc. But for this use case I found to go bare metal as the ideal case hence did not incorporate any frameworks
